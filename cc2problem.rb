# PROBLEM

# Write a Car class
# - Initialize a car with
#   - license plate number
#   - owner's name
#
# - Goals:
#   - a car can be started (turn ignition on)
#   - a car can be stopped (turn ignition off)
#   - a car can drive a given number of kilometres
#   - a car can crash by itself, or with another car
#   - a car can report its kilometrage
#   - total number of cars should be kept track of
#   - total kilometres driven by all cars in existence
#
# - Questions to ask yourself:
#   - what kind of state (i.e. instance and class variable) do you need?
#   - exactly when can a car be driven?
