#Problem 1

# [1, 12, 144, 1728, 20736, 248832, 2985984, 35831808]

# Solution 1a
#1 - Start off with an array that contains 1
#2 - Iterate over the range from 1 to 7.
#3 - Multiply the last element of the array by 12.
#4 - Shovel that result into the array.

# Solution 1b
#1 - Create an array with 8 values, each is 12*^i

# Solution 1c
#1 - Start off with an array that contains notihng
# result = []
#2 - Iterate over the range from 0 to 7.
# (0..7).each do |exponent|
#3 - Make an exponent to the last element of the array by 12.
# value = 12**exponent
#4 - Shovel that result into the array.
# result << value
